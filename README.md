# build-it-together
Welcome to week 4! Your midterm is to collaborate with the rest of your classmates to build something together. You'll use all of the knowledge you've gained thus far to create a website together. This is something that you will have to do as a professional developer if you ever decide to work with a company or with another team. 

### Submission
To submit your part of the assignment, make sure you fork this repository. To be considered complete, you'll have to have both of your pull requests merged in to this project. 

#### Warning
This is meant to be challenging. You'll all have to work together to create a great site!
